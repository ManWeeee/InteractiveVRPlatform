# VR Mechanic Simulator

## Overview
This project was developed to support mechanics by providing an affordable and safe tool for learning and exploration. Currently in the prototyping stage, it features basic interactions and simple scenarios centered around a single car. Future development has the potential to significantly enhance its usefulness and appeal by introducing more advanced learning modules, expanding the range of vehicles, and enabling users to test-drive the cars they’ve just repaired.

## Features

### 🔧 Realistic Interactions

Experience hands-on interactions between tools and car parts that closely mimic real-world mechanics. Tools respond to physical positioning and user input in intuitive, immersive ways.

### 📘 Basic Tutorial System

A simple tutorial system guides users through the core mechanics and processes, helping them learn how to interact with parts and use tools effectively.

### 🖥️ Custom UI System

An integrated user interface provides feedback, instructions, and context-sensitive options directly in the VR environment, designed for clarity and ease of use.

### 🚗 Modular Car Architecture

Car components are structured with flexibility in mind, allowing for dynamic attachment, removal, and interaction—laying the groundwork for expansion.

### 🗂️ Scene Management

Includes asynchronous scene loading and unloading to support smooth transitions between training scenarios and improved performance.

## Developer's Reflection
When I began development, the topic of virtual reality (VR) was entirely new to me. Over the course of approximately 4 to 5 months spent working on this prototype, I gained valuable experience with VR-specific features and workflows. During this time, I imported and prepared a car model for development, designed the architecture for car parts, and created a simple custom container system. I also implemented asynchronous scene loading and unloading, and integrated existing VR libraries, extending them to develop custom tools for user interaction. This project significantly expanded both my technical skills and understanding of VR development.
